# RootFinder
A PyQT5 RootFinder with a backend C++ dll

I created this project in a couple days just to experiment with ctypes and play with methods for communication between C++ and python code.
Youan turn off logging in the framework.h by setting IS_DEBUG=false if you really wanted to improve speed in the C++ code.
